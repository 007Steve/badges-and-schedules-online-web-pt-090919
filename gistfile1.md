You're hosting a conference and need to print badges for the speakers. Each badge should say: "Hello, my name is <name>."

*Write a method that will create and return this message, given a person's name.*

Now the list of speakers is finalized, and you can send the list of badges to the printer. Modify your method so it can take a list of names as an argument and return a list of badge messages. Remember that you'll need to give this list to the printer, so it should be accessible outside of the method.

Your conference speakers are: `Edsger, Ada, Charles, Alan, Grace, Linus and Matz.`

You just realized that you also need to give each speaker a room assignment. You have rooms 1-7. Write a method that assigns each speaker to a room, and make sure that each room only has one speaker. You'll need to print this for the speakers, so make sure to return a list of room assignments in the form of: "Hello, <speaker>! You'll be assigned to room <room>!"

Now you have to tell the printer what to print. Create a method that will output the results of the badge method and schedule method to the screen so the printer can do his thing.
